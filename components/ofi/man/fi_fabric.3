.BI "int fi_fabric(struct fi_fabric_attr *" attr ","
.BI "struct fid_fabric **" fabric ", void *" context ");"

.BI "int fi_close(struct fid *" fabric ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "attr" 12
Attributes of fabric to open.
.IP "fabric" 12
Fabric domain
.IP "context" 12
User specified context associated with the opened object.  This context is
returned as part of any associated asynchronous event.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
A fabric domain represents a collection of hardware and software resources
that access a single physical or virtual network.  All network ports on a
system that can communicate with each other through their attached
networks belong to the same fabric domain.  A fabric domain shares
network addresses and can span multiple providers.
.SS "fi_fabric"
Opens a fabric provider.  The attributes of the fabric provider are
specified through the open call, and may be obtained by calling fi_getinfo.
.SS "fi_close"
The fi_close call is used to release all resources associated with a fabric
domain or interface.  All items associated with the opened fabric must
be released prior to calling fi_close.
.SH "NOTES"
The following resources are associated with fabric domains: access domains,
passive endpoints, and CM event queues.
.SH "FABRIC ATTRIBUTES"
The fi_fabric_attr structure defines the set of attributes associated with a
fabric and a fabric provider.

.SS "Name"

.SS "Provider Name"
The name of the underlying fabric provider.
.SS "Provider Version"
Version information for the fabric provider.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Returns 0 on success. On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric
errno is returned. Fabric errno values are defined in 
.IR "rdma/fi_errno.h".
