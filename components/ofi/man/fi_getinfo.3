.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "node"
Optional, name or fabric address to resolve.
.IP "service"
Optional, service name or port number of address.
.IP "hints"
Reference to an fi_info structure that specifies criteria for selecting
the returned fabric information.
.IP "info"
A pointer to a linked list of fi_info structures containing response
information.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Returns information about available fabric services for reaching the specified
node or service, subject to any provided hints.  Callers must provide at least
one of the node, service, or hints parameters.  If no matching fabric information
is available, info will be set to NULL.
.PP
Either node, service, or hints must be provided.  If hints are provided, the
operation will be controlled by hints.ai_flags.  If FI_PASSIVE is
specified, the call will resolve address information for use on the
passive side of a connection.
If node is provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric address
to the given node.  The hints parameter, if provided,
may be used to control the resulting output as indicated below.
If node is not given, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric addressing
information based on the provided hints.
.PP
The caller must call fi_freeinfo to release fi_info structures returned
by this call.

.IP "next"
Pointer to the next fi_info structure in the list.  Will be NULL
if no more structures exist.
.IP "size"
Size of the fi_info structure, used for compatibility.  Callers should specify
the size of any fi_info structure passed in as hints.  The size set on any fi_info
structures returned from fi_getinfo indicates the size that was interpreted by
the providers. 
.IP "flags"
Hint flags that control the operation.  Supported flags are listed in the 
.B flags
section below.
.IP "type"
If specified, indicates the type of fabric interface communication desired.
Supported types are listed in the

section below.
.IP "protocol"
If specified, indicates the desired communication protocol. Supported protocols
are listed in the
.B "Protocols"
section below.
.IP "protocol_cap"
If specified, indicates the desired communication protocol capabilities. Supported
capabilities are listed in the
.B "Protocol capabilities"
section below.
.IP "iov_format"
If specified, indicates the format used for vectored data communications. Supported
formats are listed in the

If specified, indicates the format used for addressing in data transfer
operations. Supported formats
are listed in the
.B "Addressing formats"
section below.
.IP "info_addr_format"

Supported formats are listed in the
.B "Addressing formats"
section below.
.IP "src_addrlen"
Indicates the length of the source address (must be specified if
.B src_addr
is specified).
.IP "dest_addrlen"
Indicates the length of the destination address (must be specified if
.B dst_addr
is specified).
.IP "src_addr"
If specified, indicates the source address.
.IP "dest_addr"
If specified, indicates the destination address.
.IP "auth_keylen"
Indicates the size of the authentication key (must be specified if
.B auth_key
is specified).
.IP "auth_key"
Authorization key to limit communication among sockets that share
the same key.
.IP "shared_fd"
If specified, is used to authenticate a domain to share resources with
other processes on the same node that have access to the same shared_fd.
.IP "fabric_name"
If specified, the name of the fabric domain.
.IP "domain_name"
If specified, the name of the access domain.
.IP "datalen"
Length of any additional data (must be specified if
.B data
is specified).
.IP "data"
Any additional data about communication interface being requested.  Data is
provider specific.  It is primarily used as output from fi_getinfo, to be
provided as input into fi_domain or fi_endpoint.
.SH "FLAGS"
.IP "FI_PASSIVE"
Indicates that the fabric endpoint will be used to listen for connection
requests.
.IP "FI_NUMERICHOST"
Indicates that the node name is a numeric address.  When set, name resolution
is not performed.
.IP "FI_BLOCK"
Specifies that an asynchronous or non-blocking operation should block until
the operation completes.
.IP "FI_EXCL"
Specifies that a fabric resource domain should not share resource with another
open domain.  By default, resources are shared across multiple open calls by
the same process.
.IP "FI_BUFFERED_RECV"
If set, the communication interface implementation should attempt to queue inbound
data that arrives before a receive buffer has been posted.  In the
absence of this flag, any messages that arrive before a receive is
posted are lost.
When set, the user must use 
.B struct fi_context 
as their per operation context.
.IP "FI_BUFFERED_SEND"
If set, the outbound data buffer should be returned to user immediately after
the call returns, even if the operation is handled asynchronously.  This may
require that the communication interface implementation copy the data into a
local buffer and transfer out of that buffer.
.IP "FI_CANCEL"
Indicates that the user wants the ability to cancel the operation if it does
not complete first.  Providers use this to return a handle to the request,
which the user may then cancel.  Also used by search to indicate that a request
should be canceled.
When set, the user must use 
.B struct fi_context 
as their per operation context.
.IP "FI_SHARED_RECV"
An endpoint created with this flag will share the same receive queue as other
endpoints created on the same domain.
.IP "FI_READ"
Used to enable read access to data buffers.
.IP "FI_WRITE"
Used to enable write access to data buffers.
.IP "FI_REMOTE"
Used to enable access for remote processes. It is intended to be combined with
.BR "FI_READ " or " FI_WRITE" 
to specify remote read, remote write or remote read and write permissions.
.IP "FI_RECV"
Used to indicate that the fabric object will be used for receive operations.
.IP "FI_SEND"
Used to indicate that the fabric object will be used for send operations.
.IP "FI_AUTO_RESET [not valid for fi_getinfo]"
Automatically resets the event queue to generate a new wake-up event on the
next entry.  Example use: 1. wait on eq wait object -- poll(fd) 2. wait object
is ready -- fd is readable 3. read eq to retrieve events 4. continue reading
until read returns 0
.IP "FI_PEEK [not valid for fi_getinfo]"
If used, indicates that if the application reads an event queue, the particular
completion entry is not removed from the queue and is visible to subsequent reads.
.IP "FI_IMM [not valid for fi_getinfo]"
Indicates that immediate data is available.  Immediate data is communicated to a
receiver through completion data, rather than appearing in targeted receive
buffers.
.IP "FI_NOCOMP [not valid for fi_getinfo]"
Indicates that no completion should be generated for the specified operation.
.IP "FI_MORE [not valid for fi_getinfo]"
.I Write me
.IP "FI_SIGNAL"
Indicates if a completion event should be generated.
.IP "FI_ACK"
Indicates that a completion event is not generated until the operation
initiated is acknowledged by the remote side.  This ususally implies that
the transfered data has been successfully placed into memory on the remote
system.

.SH "NOTES"
If hints are provided, the
operation will be controlled by the values that are supplied in the various
fields (see section on
.IR "fi_info").
Applications that require specific communication interfaces, domains,
capabilities or other requirements, can specify them using fields in
.IR "hints".
Libfabric returns a linked list in
.I info
that points to a list of matching interfaces.  
.I info 
is set to NULL if there are no communication interfaces or none match
the input hints.
.PP
If node is provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric address
to the given node.  If node is not provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve
the fabric addressing information based on the provided hints.  The caller must
