All patches submitted for inclusion must include a signed-off-by line.
This mechanism is the same to that used by the Linux kernel:

The signed-off-by is a line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are simple: if you
can certify the below:

       Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1
 
       By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
 
       (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
           have the right to submit it under the open source license
           indicated in the file; or
 
       (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
           of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
           license and I have the right under that license to submit that
           work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
           by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
           permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
           in the file; or
 
       (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
           person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
           it.
 
       (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
           are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
           personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
           maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
           this project or the open source license(s) involved.
 
then you just add a line saying

Signed-off-by: Random Developer <random@developer.example.org>

using your real name.
